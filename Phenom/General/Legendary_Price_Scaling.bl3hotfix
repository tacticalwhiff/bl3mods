### Modify the legendary price multiplier.
###
### I felt that the legendaries were too cheap, they are now 10 times more expensive in all vending machines in cash, including Black Market.
### Since it's a multiplier you can change it to whatever you want. For example you can put 0.5 for 50% of the Vanilla price.
###
### Vanilla: 10.0
### Mod default (x10): 100.0
